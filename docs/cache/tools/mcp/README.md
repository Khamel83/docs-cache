## What is MCP?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open-source standard for connecting AI applications to external systems.

Using MCP, AI applications like Claude or ChatGPT can connect to:
- **Data sources** (e.g. local files, databases)
- **Tools** (e.g. search engines, calculators)
- **Workflows** (e.g. specialized prompts)

Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect electronic devices, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI applications to external systems.

## What can MCP enable?

- Agents can access your Google Calendar and Notion, acting as a more personalized AI assistant.
- Claude Code can generate an entire web app using a Figma design.
- Enterprise chatbots can connect to multiple databases across an organization, empowering users to analyze data using chat.
- AI models can create 3D designs on Blender and print them out using a 3D printer.

## Why does MCP matter?

Depending on where you sit in the ecosystem, MCP can have a range of benefits.

- **Developers**: MCP reduces development time and complexity when building, or integrating with, an AI application or agent.
- **AI applications or agents**: MCP provides access to an ecosystem of data sources, tools and apps which will enhance capabilities and improve the end-user experience.
- **End-users**: MCP results in more capable AI applications or agents which can access your data and take actions on your behalf when necessary.

## Start Building

- Create an MCP server
- Use existing MCP servers
- Integrate with Claude Desktop or other MCP clients
